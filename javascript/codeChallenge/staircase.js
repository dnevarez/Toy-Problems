// Consider a staircase of size n = 4:
//
//      #
//     ##
//    ###
//   ####
//
// Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn
// using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

// The staircase is right-aligned.

// Write a function that takes in one parameter n and prints a staircase.
