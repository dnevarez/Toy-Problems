// Everyone knows if you say BeetleJuice three times he appears!
//
// Well Lydia wants to invite some new ghosts into her home but has a cold that is
// making her throat too sore to speak and is on some crazy cold medicine that's
// making her brain fuzzy!
//
// She wrote a program that takes the input of the ghost she wants to appear and
// says it three times for her in the form of a string! But she needs you to fix
// it while she recovers from her cold!
//
// EXAMPLE : beetleJuice("Harry!") => "Harry!  Harry!  Harry!"
//
// Note: each name in the example needs to be separated by exactly TWO spaces.
// (there will be no wild inputs just names followed by exclamation points in string form)
