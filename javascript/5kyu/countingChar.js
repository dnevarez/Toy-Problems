// Create a function that takes in 3 arguments. A string (text), and number (max)
// for the maximum character count, and a boolean (spaces), indicating whether or
// not spaces are counted in the total of the string length.
//
// Return an array. The first item should be a boolean, indicating whether or not
// string length falls within the max character count. The second should be the string.
//
// If the text argument is longer than the max character count. The returned string
// should show the text up to where the max character count cuts off. The result
// vary based on whether spaces is true or false.
//
// If the text argument is equal to or less than the max character count. The entire
// text will be returned as the second item in the array.
