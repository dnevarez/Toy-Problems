# An array is given with palindromic and non-palindromic numbers. Palindromic number is a number that is the same from a reveresed order. For example 122 is not a palindromic number but 202 is one.
#
# Your task is to write a function that returns an array with only 1s and 0s, where all palindromic number is replaced with a 1 and all non-palindromic number of the original array replaced with a 0.
#
# For example:
#
# [101, 2, 85, 33, 14014] will return [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
# 
# and [45, 21, 303, 56] will return [0, 0, 1, 0]

# My Answer

def convert_palindromes(numbers)
  numbers.map do |num|
    num.to_s == num.to_s.reverse ? 1 : 0
  end
end
